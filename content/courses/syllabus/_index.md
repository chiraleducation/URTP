## Who this course is for
We welcome students from all science and bioscience majors and even non-science majors with appropriate backgrounds and interests. Projects span the spectrum of biomedical science, including projects in public health, health data science, and computational biology.

- If you have no research experience but want to learn the necessary concepts in health research, this is the right place, to begin with.
- This course is excellent if you have no data analysis experience but want to know the end-to-end data analysis processes, from data collection to reporting writing.
- If you have some experience but are not confident enough to start your project, you can start from here.
- If you are an undergrad student and planning to start your research journey, this course will help you.

## Course Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites, and we do not assume any prior background in research, data analysis, or statistics.



## Course Policies
Please use the information below to reference how this class will be conducted. We ask that you review this information before contacting us with any questions.
 
### News and Announcements
As much as possible, we use `Discord` for new announcements. Discord is a chatroom for discussion. The participants can interact with mentors and share their problems and solutions quickly.

- Rule 4: No nicknames designed to annoy other users

### Assignment Policies 
- 20% of your grade during regular class hours.
- 40% of your grade will come from a 5-10 page report exploring one of the class syllabus's research areas. We expect students to use original data collection, whether quantitative or qualitative analysis, to answer the questions posed.
Your attendance and participation in class will determine 20% of your grade.
- 20% of your grade will come from 2-page research proposal writing that you must complete in two separate weeks of the course.

### Attendance Policy
Your attendance and participation grade is divided into two parts: 10% comes from your presence in class and 10% from your participation during discussion. We will allow you to miss three courses during the program for any reason: you do not need to inform us ahead of time unless you are missing for an approved reason(i.e., university activity, sickness) and would like the absence to be expected.

### Make-Up Assignment Policy
If an event outside of your control causes you to miss an assignment, please email our management team as soon as possible so alternative arrangements can be made. Please note that we do not reschedule tasks for the participant's vacations.
