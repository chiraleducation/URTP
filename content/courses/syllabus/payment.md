## Phage 1: Pre-registration 
- The interested students have to complete our pre-registration process. After pre-registration ends, they will call for an orientation meeting where the URTP team explains the goals and outcomes of this training program. 
- After completing the orientation program, students will ask to sign an agreement for one year, enabling them to move on to the second phase, which is payment completion and starting the classes. 

## Phage 2: Payment
